# KDD CUP 2012 TRACK2

__ Introduction: <br> Clickthrough rate (CTR) __
is a ratio showing how often people who see your ad end up clicking it. Clickthrough rate (CTR) can be used to gauge how well your keywords and ads are performing.

- CTR is the number of clicks that your ad receives divided by the number of times your ad is shown: clicks รท impressions = CTR. For example, if you had 5 clicks and 100 impressions, then your CTR would be 5%.

- Each of your ads and keywords have their own CTRs that you can see listed in your account.
- A high CTR is a good indication that users find your ads helpful and relevant. CTR also contributes to your keyword's expected CTR, which is a component of Ad Rank. Note that a good CTR is relative to what you're advertising and on which networks.
